## What Is It:
* HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. operates as a cryptocurrency mining company in Canada, Sweden, and Iceland. It was incorporated in 1987 with headquarters in Vancouver, Canada. The company was formerly known as Leeta Gold Corp. and changed its name to HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. in September 2017. The company is involved in the mining and sale of digital currencies, such as Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, and Bitcoin. 

* HIVE uses high powered computing assets to mine cryptocurrencies and validate transactions on blockchain networks for rewards paid in cryptocurrencies. The biggest costs incurred during mining of cryptocurrencies are electricity costs, hardware and fast internet. They owns state-of-the-art green energy-powered data centre facilities in Canada, Sweden and Iceland.  The reason for Hive to have the data centres in these countries is enjoy the low cost green/renewable energy and stable governments. Hive follows the below formula to operate business and generate profits:

** Gross Mining Profitability =f(
                                    (FACILITY HASH RATE,
                                    POWER CONSUMPTION)^1,
                                    (COIN PRICE,
                                    NETWORK HASH RATE)^2,
                                    (COST PER KWH,
                                    MAINTENANCE COSTS)^3 
                                ) **
